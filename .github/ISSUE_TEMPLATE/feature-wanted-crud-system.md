any self-respect application need some sort of data management otherwise it will be not so different a toy or some kind of programming playing so with the intend of make that application more robust creating a crud system is somthing required.

until that commit that unnamed program has no actual database, so the user can put your name, age, gender, and also one discription about himself but that data are going to no where that`s why i said that at the moment it looks like just a toy there`s no actual function 

for now i made a json archive and use in my main js archive and called my database backbone, because is how i planned to work with that archives i still need learn more about database and css but i fell like i am in right way
