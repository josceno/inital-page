Pagina inicial Ver 1.0.0


That is a application made with node some css and html, the main focus is be one template for me study java script and node obviously a wanna make them look more beautiful as well i aiming put my efforts to make that application as better as possible obviously i might try another projects and another languages as well but for now i kind wanna be as best that i can be in java script and some of their framework, and then i will focus in anther sort of works. As can be noticed im not exactly that good using Github either so thats will be a good opportunity to learn too

introduced made there is some basic introductions for that application using: 
     1. there is a rar archive inside desafio folder extract then inside that folder and that will work fine 
     2. After that program run in node.js framework so have that framework installed is required
     3. also use npm install or install the required modules
     


1.0.0: versions note 
    you can enter your name, age, and gender, also type a text with around 10000 characters(that open text also have a word count ).  
    there is some graphical  errors whe nothing is type mainly on date, but fix that is not on my top priorities right now, for now i will do the brute code and after will polish the product. 
    also i still have some issues withe the text counter, not a grate problem but some small issues that i want fix 
    
    next step is add some crude system  for make that application somehow more "real"
